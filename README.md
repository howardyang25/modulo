# Modulo
A social network for anyone interested in becoming better versions of themselves. 

## Description
Modulo is a todo list app that leverages social accountability and collective creativity to help users build useful daily habits. 

## Summary
Create an account and sign in to browse tasks shared by the Modulo community. If you have a good idea for a task, share it yourself! Add tasks from the home page to your profile to be checked off on your own time. Gauge difficulty and get motivated by seeing how many people have completed the same task. Want to cheer somebody on? Send a shoutout!

## Problem
Most people want to improve themselves but don't know where to start or what to do. Even with knowledge, it's insanely difficult to stay the path. It's difficult to do anything alone, so here is where Modulo comes in. 

## Solution
Modulo inserts itself into both steps of the self-improvement process. Figuring out what to do, and making sure to do it. First, our diverse users come up with small, doable tasks that many of us may never have considered. Once you find a task to your liking, accept it and you're in. You no longer just have to do it for yourself, but for the community. Strive for a global 100% completion rate for each task, and shout out your peers. 

## From the creator
"I can't count how many times I've set my mind on self-improvement and fallen off the wagon immediately. There was just not enough immediate reward or accountability when I went it alone. I wanted to create a way for people like me to team up and motivate each other. Setting a goal to take on and complete just one task a day has helped me gradually but tremendously. Modulo is as great as its community, and I look forward to seeing it grow." - Howard Yang

## How to Get Started
All you need to do is create an account and you can use all the functionality that Modulo offers. Not the most creative? No problem. Just browse through tasks that other users have posted, and take them for yourself. There is absolutely no pressure to share. Additionally, your personal tasks are private to you, and shout-outs are sent randomly, so your list is yours alone. 

## Customer Quote
"Modulo rocks! I love seeing the global progress bar tick up and up. Even if I don't feel like completing a task sometimes, I'll do it for the team, chasing that sweet hundred percent completion."
